# Node.js Mentorship Program

I've read some of the reviews of mentees from the previous cohorts on Node.js collection's medium page and I think I can learn a lot from this program as well as contribute to the commnuity too. I've been using Node.js and would definitely love an opportunity to learn a lot more about how it works and contribute the bit I can to its continuity. I want to learn more about the Node.js ecosystem and I'm ready to put in the all the work required with the help of a mentor. I've equally been reading a lot about how Javascript works under the hood, the event loop, call stack, chrome's javascript v8 engine etc. I know this will be a great platform for learning more about these features. I've also always been interested in the idea of opensource and collaboration and I would love to actively get involved in it with proper mentorship. I'm very self-motivated and if I'm accepted, I will make sure to show the required dedication and ensure that the purpose of the program is realized.
